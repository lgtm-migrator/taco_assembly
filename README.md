# Taco Assembly

A web page to compile a list of custom tacos developed by you and generated randomly with ingredients provided by ClickTime's API. Yummy!

## Getting Started

 1. Ensure that npm and node are installed on your local machine or where this project will live
 2. Clone the project with ssh: 
 ### `git clone git@github.com:rupaltotale/taco_assembly.git` 
 or with https: 
 ### `git clone https://github.com/rupaltotale/taco_assembly.git`
 3. Go into the project directory (replace taco_assembly with the name you provided the project when cloning it): 
 ### `cd taco_assembly`  
 4. Install dependencies for the project: 
 ### `npm install`
 5. Build and run the project:

 This should take you directly to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) or a subsequent port if that port is running something else.
